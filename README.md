# Machine Learning Course with TensorFlow

## Overview
Welcome to the **Johnny's Machine Learning Course** repository! ðŸš€ This project contains all the source codes, datasets, and structured lessons for learning machine learning with TensorFlow. The content follows a structured curriculum, progressing from basic concepts to advanced deep learning techniques.

## Getting Started
### **Prerequisites**
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.9+

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Running a Lesson**
To run any lesson, navigate to the corresponding directory and execute the script. Example:
```bash
cd 101
python 101_3.py
```

### **Lessons Available**
Each numbered folder corresponds to a different module in the course:
- `101`: Introduction to Machine Learning
- `102`: Deep Learning Basics
- `103`: Advanced Deep Learning

### **Data Usage**
Some lessons use datasets stored in the `data/` folder. Ensure that dataset files are present before running the scripts.
